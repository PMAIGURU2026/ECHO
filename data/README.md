All CSVs and PDFs ECHO depends on. Files are committed to the repo so a fresh clone can run the full pipeline without re-downloading anything.

All sources are public domain (CMS, CDC, KFF, NCHS) or open-access peer-reviewed (Cureus, CC-BY 4.0).

- **HCAHPS-Hospital (full national file):** https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/dgck-syfz
  - After download, run `python scripts/filter_hcahps_to_ny.py` to produce the NY-only file. Do not commit the full national file (~102 MB).

  - Pick measure (PPC-AD, PPC-CH, PPC2-AD, PPC2-CH, or CCP-CH), filter to NY, export CSV

## Refresh Process

If a file goes stale:

1. Download the new version from the source URL above
2. Rename to match the filename in this README (CMS filenames in the wild are ugly; we rename for code readability)
3. For HCAHPS specifically: drop the full national file in `data/`, run `python scripts/filter_hcahps_to_ny.py`, then delete the full file
4. Open the file and confirm column headers haven't changed. If they have, update `src/commitment_ingester.py` and `src/outcome_scorer.py` to match
5. Run the full test suite: `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/ -v`
6. Update the "Downloaded" date in the table above
7. Commit with message: `chore(data): refresh [filename] from [source] [YYYY-MM-DD]`

## What's NOT in here

These are referenced in PRD as v2 expansion sources but not committed in v1:

- CMS Maternal Health Hospital file (severe maternal morbidity)
- CMS FY2025 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
- CMS Hospital Provider Cost Report (Medicaid payer mix)
- CMS Medicaid Core Set: PCR-AD, PDS-AD, LRCD-AD
- CDC WONDER state-level mortality exports
- Full national HCAHPS-Hospital.csv (NY-filtered version is in v1)

If you're building toward v2, download these from the URLs in PRD's "v2 expansion sources" section and add to this folder with a corresponding row above.

## Notes on Specific Files

### Birthing_Friendly_Hospitals_Geocoded.csv

2,265 rows nationally, 101 NY. Fields: name, addr, city, state, zip, lat, lon. **Has no CCN.** Tool 1 joins this to `HCAHPS-Hospital-NY.csv` by name (with normalization for the 6 NY hospitals whose names don't exactly match) to recover the CCN.

### HCAHPS-Hospital-NY.csv

NY-only filtered version. 161 facilities, ~10,900 measure rows, ~3.3 MB. Filtered from the full 102 MB CMS export using `scripts/filter_hcahps_to_ny.py`. Tool 2 reads three measures: `H_COMP_6_STAR_RATING`, `H_STAR_RATING`, `H_DISCH_HELP_Y_P`.

### core-set-ppc-ad-ny.csv

The "core-set-data-dashboard" exports come with a multi-row preamble (Title, Timeframe, etc.) before the actual CSV header. Tool 2 skips these preamble rows when parsing. NY 2023 rate = 82.4%. **Primary state benchmark for the within-state mismatch story.**

### Other core-set-*.csv files

`core-set-ppc-ch-ny.csv`, `core-set-ppc2-ad-ny.csv`, `core-set-ppc2-ch-ny.csv`, `core-set-ccp-ch-ny.csv`. Same preamble format as PPC-AD. **Supporting context only** — displayed in the briefing card sidebar to show NY is top quartile across the board, but not used in scoring math.

### kff_postpartum_coverage.csv

Has a 2-row preamble like the CMS Core Set files. Tool 4 reads the "12-month extension implemented" status for the hospital's state. NY = implemented June 2023. Drives the `medicaid_extended` field and the financial email variant.

### nnpqc_funding.csv

State-level perinatal quality collaborative funding status. NY = funded. Used as supporting context in the briefing card.

### hestat113.pdf and cureus-racial-disparity.pdf

Citation only. Not parsed by any tool. The dashboard cites these; values are extracted manually into `src/constants.py` if needed (e.g., racial disparity ratios for `racial_disparity_flag` calculation).
