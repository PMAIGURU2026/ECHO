"""
Tests for Tool 2 — outcome_scorer.

Runs against the real CSVs in data/. A module-scoped fixture pipes
real Tool 1 output through score_outcomes() once; tests assert shape,
types, allowed values, no-hospital-dropped, no-mutation, no removed
v0.1 fields, and identity preservation per SCHEMA.md.

v1 covers NY only; the state benchmark is a hardcoded constant
(NY 2023 = 82.4) sourced from data/core-set-ppc-ad-ny.csv for citation
but not parsed at runtime — it is the same value on every NY hospital
dict.
